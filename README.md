# odin-recipes
Hey there! I'm diving into the Odin Recipes project, a cool web development adventure. Here's the lowdown:

What I'm Learning:

Making Web Pages: Starting simple with Iteration 1, I'm crafting the main page (index.html) with basic HTML—just the usual stuff. Tossed in a catchy "Odin Recipes" heading.

Linking Pages: In Iteration 2, I'm figuring out how to make separate recipe pages like 'lasagna.html' and connecting them back to the main page. Getting the hang of links.

Page Content Magic: Now, in Iteration 3, I'm jazzing up my recipe pages. Adding images, descriptions, ingredients, and steps. Basically, making them look tasty!

More Recipes, Please: Iteration 4 is about going big. Adding two more recipes and making sure everything looks neat with a list of links.

Showcasing My Work: Finally, I'm putting my project on the web using GitHub Pages. Everyone can check out my cooking masterpiece.

Why It's Simple:

The project's designed for beginners. No need for fancy designs—just nailing down the basics. Once I'm a coding pro, I can spice things up. Right now, it's all about learning and building that web foundation. Let's get cooking! 🚀👩‍🍳
